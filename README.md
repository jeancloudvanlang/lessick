# lessick #

a tiny rake script to do a bit less zauber.
It lives to serve Regina. So it can compiles all your given less files to a given directory of your choice (#magic).

** You have to ad(d)just the less and css file directories**

### What do I need for running that shit? ###

* Ruby 1.9 up 
* `therubyracer` gem
* the less gem

On MacOs I would prefer installing everything with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

* brew installieren
* `brew install ruby`
* `gem install less`
* `gem install therubyracer`
